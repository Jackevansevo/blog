I never thought the day would come, but I'm happily typing up this post from a Windows machine

Similar to a large proportion of the global IT workforce, I've been forced to work remotely from home for the past five months. Consequently I've needed overhaul some of my personal computing infrastructure, replacing what were previously hobby devices, into something more professional and reliable.

## The Good

Let's start with the good. After around a decade of primarily using Linux on the desktop, switching to Windows felt like a very daunting prospect. I'm fairly pleased to announce that the process of switching has been fairly seamless. So much so that after taking this experimental leap, I fear I may never feel compelled to return to Linux (if only in a hobby capacity).

### WSL

My Linux development setup was very straight forward, 99.9% of my time was spent in either a terminal or a web browser, nothing complicated at all. As such, I'm able to perfectly my entire Linux development setup within Windows by leveraging WSL. If I ever need a clean slate to work from, I can simply reinstall the target OS.

with the recent addition of WSL 2 and the deep integration with Visual Studio Code.

### Applications

I'm able to reliably talk to my friends on Discord without the application consistently segfaulting.

## Things that work out of the box

### Drivers

### Power management settings

On windows I'm finally able to configure certain power management tools that were previously virtually impossible to achieve under Linux.

A prime example of this is using the Lenovo Vantage tool to configure the batteries maximum charge capacity, a measure that's vital for improvement battery longevity.

### Peripherals

I'm able to use

## The Bad

### Font Rendering

After a month of usage I think I've finally come to terms with just now awful the font rendering is on Windows.

What's frustrating is applications such as VSCode and Windows Terminal appear to render font nicely, and others appear to not. The resulting effect means it's completely jarring when you switch between applications.
